# They are binary files and we can't easily view difffs on them, so it wouldn't be super useful #
# We track the code that generates them, so we don't need them #

# Don't track the data - it's confidential and huge! #

# But track the markdown style file, in case ever break it! #

# Note excel and csv could be important mapping tables, so worth tracking these! #
# Except this one which is data#
