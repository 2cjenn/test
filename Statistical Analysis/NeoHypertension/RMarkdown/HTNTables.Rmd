![Hypertension is defined as self-report of a prior diagnosis of hypertension in touchscreen questionnaire (TQ) or verbal interview (VI), or self-report of hypertensive medication in TQ or in VI by our rubric, or mean SBP >= 140 mmHg or mean DBP >= 90 mmHg at baseline assessment. Among those with hypertension, participants are considered to be unaware hypertensives if they did not self-report a prior diagnosis of hypertension in TQ or VI, or self-report hypertensive medication in TQ or in VI by our rubric; otherwise aware. Among those who are aware of their hypertension, participants are considered to be untreated hypertensives if they did not report hypertensive medication in TQ or in VI by our rubric; otherwise treated. Among those who self-reported treatment for their hypertension, they are considered to be inadequately treated if mean SBP >= 140 mmHg or mean DBP >= 90 mmHg at baseline assessment; otherwise controlled. ](K:/TEU/APOE on Dementia/Statistical Analysis/NeoHypertension/RMarkdown/PrevPct.png){height=300px}
